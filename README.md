# Project Title

## Description of the Project

I built a Spring Boot backend for a video game e-commerce store using a MySQL database, where I implemented and debugged REST API endpoints for categories and products. I fixed critical bugs in product search filtering and product updates to ensure correct results, I attempted to implement a shopping cart but I was unable to do so.

## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a shopper, I want to search for video game products by category, price range, and sub-category, so that I can easily find products that match my preferences.
- As a shopper, I want to view detailed information for a single product, so that I can decide whether I want to purchase it.
- As an administrator, I want to add new video game products to the store, so that the catalog stays up to date.
- As an administrator, I want to update existing product information, so that prices, inventory, and descriptions remain accurate.
- As an administrator, I want to remove products from the store, so that discontinued items are no longer available.
